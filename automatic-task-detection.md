# Automatic Task Detection Feature

## Overview

The Automatic Task Detection feature enhances the Focus Nudge extension by intelligently identifying what tasks users are trying to accomplish without requiring explicit declaration. This feature uses machine learning and behavioral pattern recognition to detect common productivity tasks and provide contextual focus assistance.

## Problem Statement

While the Task-Specific Focus feature allows users to manually declare their intended tasks, this creates friction in the user experience. Many users may not take the time to set up task sessions, or they might switch tasks without updating the system. Automatic detection solves this by passively recognizing task patterns and proactively offering assistance.

## Feature Description

The Automatic Task Detection feature will:

1. **Identify common productivity tasks** without user declaration
2. **Suggest task-specific focus modes** based on detected activities
3. **Learn from user behavior** to improve detection accuracy over time
4. **Provide seamless transitions** between different detected tasks
5. **Respect user privacy** by performing all analysis locally

## Implementation Details

### Detection Mechanisms

1. **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**
   - Analyze navigation patterns and page interactions
   - Identify sequences that match known task signatures
   - Example: Job application pattern = job listings → company research → application form

2. **Machine Learning Classification**
   - Train models on common productivity tasks
   - Use features including:
     - URL patterns and structures
     - Page content keywords and semantic analysis
     - User interaction types (form filling, reading, scrolling)
     - Session timing and duration
     - Tab management patterns

3. **Contextual Clues Analysis**
   - Page titles and metadata
   - Form interactions and input types
   - Content consumption patterns (reading vs. scanning)
   - Media interaction (video watching, document viewing)

4. **User History Integration**
   - Learn from previously declared or confirmed tasks
   - Build personalized task profiles for individual users
   - Recognize recurring tasks and their typical contexts

### Technical Components

1. **Local ML Model**
   - Lightweight model running entirely in the browser
   - Pre-trained on common task patterns
   - Incrementally updated based on user feedback
   - Optimized for low resource consumption

2. **Heuristic Rules Engine**
   - First-pass detection using deterministic rules
   - Domain-specific patterns for common websites
   - Fallback when ML confidence is low

3. **Task Confidence Scoring**
   - Calculate confidence level for each detected task
   - Only suggest tasks above threshold confidence
   - Track accuracy over time to improve suggestions

4. **Privacy-Preserving Design**
   - All detection happens locally in the browser
   - No sensitive content is transmitted externally
   - Anonymized, aggregated learning data only (with consent)

### User Interface

1. **Subtle Task Detection Notifications**
   - Non-intrusive suggestions: "It looks like you're researching a topic. Enable Research Focus Mode?"
   - Easy single-click acceptance or dismissal
   - Option to modify detected parameters

2. **Automatic Mode Transitions**
   - Seamlessly switch between detected tasks
   - Provide transition summaries: "You spent 45 minutes on job applications and are now switching to learning"

3. **Task Detection Dashboard**
   - View of currently detected task and confidence level
   - History of detected tasks and time spent
   - Ability to correct misidentifications

## User Experience Flow

1. User begins browsing job listings on LinkedIn
2. System detects pattern consistent with job hunting (80% confidence)
3. After sufficient confidence is established, system shows subtle notification:
   "It looks like you're applying to jobs. Enable Job Application Focus Mode?"
4. User clicks "Yes" (or system auto-enables if user has set preferences)
5. System begins tracking job application specific metrics
6. If user deviates (e.g., browsing social media), system provides contextual nudges
7. When user switches to a different task, system detects the change and updates accordingly

## Privacy Considerations

- All content analysis happens locally in the browser
- No page content or personal information is transmitted externally
- Users can disable automatic detection entirely
- Clear explanations of what is being analyzed and why
- Transparency about detection mechanisms and confidence levels

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of correctly identified tasks (accuracy)
- User acceptance rate of task suggestions
- Reduction in manual task declarations
- Improvement in focus metrics during automatically detected tasks
- User satisfaction with detection relevance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Task Prediction**
   - Anticipate upcoming tasks based on time of day, day of week, and previous patterns
   - Proactively suggest task modes before user begins

2. **Cross-Device Learning**
   - Synchronize task profiles across devices (with encryption)
   - Maintain consistent detection regardless of device used

3. **Integration with Productivity Tools**
   - Connect with calendars to incorporate meeting and deadline awareness
   - Integrate with task management tools to align with declared priorities

4. **Advanced Context Awareness**
   - Consider location, time of day, and device type in detection
   - Adapt to changing work patterns and priorities

5. **Collaborative Task Detection**
   - Recognize when tasks involve collaboration (meetings, shared documents)
   - Adjust focus parameters for collaborative vs. individual work
