# Source Code

This directory will contain modular source code for the Focus Nudge extension.

## Planned Structure

As the extension grows, code will be refactored into this directory with the following structure:

- `src/tracking/`: Event tracking and data collection modules
- `src/analysis/`: Data processing and feature extraction
- `src/ml/`: Machine learning model integration
- `src/ui/`: User interface components
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers

This modular approach will make the codebase more maintainable as features are added.
